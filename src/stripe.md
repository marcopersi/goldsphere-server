2. How to Get These Keys:
Go to your Stripe Dashboard: https://dashboard.stripe.com
API Keys:
Go to Developers → API keys
Copy your "Secret key" and "Publishable key"
Webhook Secret:
Go to Developers → Webhooks
Create a new webhook endpoint (or use existing)
Point it to: https://yourdomain.com/api/payments/webhook
Copy the "Signing secret"

4. To Test/Activate:
Once you provide the API keys, we can:

Add them to your environment variables
Test the payment endpoints
Verify webhook functionality
Test the complete order → payment → fulfillment flow
Can you provide your Stripe API keys? (Secret Key, Publishable Key, and Webhook Secret)

Also, let me know:

Are you using Test Mode or Live Mode?
Do you want me to help you set up the webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard?
The codebase is already fully prepared for Stripe integration - we just need the credentials!
